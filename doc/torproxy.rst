===================
DNF torproxy Plugin
===================

-----------
Description
-----------

Automatically pass all traffic in the tor network, and abort if tor is not running or blocked, to avoid any kind
of identity leak.

However, if there is a specific proxy settings in the configuration, the plugin will not
overwrite it, assuming that the user did set it on purpose.

-------------
Configuration
-------------

``/etc/dnf/plugins/torproxy.conf``

The minimal content of conf file should contain ``main`` sections with parameters ``enabled`` and
``strict``, otherwise plugin will not work. If the ``strict`` parameter is set to ``True``, torproxy plugin will halt DNF in the case of Tor network unavailability.::

  [main]
  enabled = true
  strict = false

If you do not want to use the default setup of tor, ie running it on the localhost, you can also specify
the port and host of the tor client in a torproxy section like this::

  [torproxy]
  port = 9050
  host = tor.example.org
